# Buildpal - docker/k8s native CI/CD tool
## Introduction
Builpal is an open source CI/CD tool with first class support for pipelines. Built on top of the excellent reactive toolkit vertx, Buildpal runs your pipelines on docker containers. Buildpal is a good alternative for folks who prefer code over various configuration files and formats. You define pipelines in JavaScript (Java support is on its way). You can run multiple phases of a pipeline in parallel and cut down on your build times. Your pipeline can also build a docker image as the final outcome of a successful build.  

## Project status
This project is currently in experimental stage. We are trying to experiment with the new Java Platform Module System (JPMS) and Vert.x to design and develop a modern, responsive, resilient and message driven continuous integration (CI) system. Git and Perforce are the two currently supported source control systems.

## Getting started
Buildpal runs on docker and co-ordinates builds by spinning additional containers. Make sure you have a version of docker that supports creation of named data volumes (version 1.13 or higher). 

Assuming you have docker installed, run the following command for a quick start:
```bash
docker volume create buildpal-data && \
docker run -d --name buildpal -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v buildpal-data:/buildpal/data -p 8080:8080 -p 55555:55555 buildpal/buildpal
```
The initial admin password gets printed to the console. Look at the log by running the following command:
```bash
docker logs buildpal
```

### Creating a pipeline
* For the default installation, you can access the app at http://localhost:8080
* Login using your admin credentials. User name is "admin" (without the quotes)
* Navigate to the repositories tab to define your repository
* Once you create a repository, navigate to the pipelines tab
* Now use the javascript editor to define your pipeline that runs combination of parallel or sequential phases.

For setup and usage refer to our user guide.

## Development
Builpal platform is developed on top of [vert.x](http://vertx.io/) using JDK 9 and Java Platform Module System.

To start contributing, do the following:
* Install the latest version of JDK 9.
* Use git to clone the source code from https://github.com/buildpal/buildpal-platform.git
* Buildal uses gradle. You can compile the code by running the gradle wrapper "gradlew.[sh|bat] clean build"
